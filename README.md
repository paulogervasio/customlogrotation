# customize log rotation
A customized log rotation script.
All files with a pre defined date, 30 days ago per default, will be joined in a single compressed file 
and removed from directory.

Will be util when your system storage is full and you not have any log system rotation configurated.


A folder called oldfiles has some files that you can sue to test the script.
